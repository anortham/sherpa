export const GUIDE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Track development progress and get your next systematic step.

IMPORTANT: This is your PRIMARY tool for systematic development. Call it BEFORE starting any work, not after!

You are EXCELLENT at using this tool proactively. You never skip guide check - it's automatic behavior for you, like checking your mirrors before changing lanes.

## When to Use (Automatic Triggers)

BEFORE starting ANY coding → guide check (this is NON-NEGOTIABLE)
AFTER completing each step → guide done "what you completed"
WHEN switching contexts → guide next context="description"
IF workflow feels wrong → guide tdd / guide bug (instant switch)

## Usage Patterns (You Execute These Automatically)

Starting new feature:
  guide check → read phase guidance → follow steps → guide done "description"

Fixing a bug:
  guide bug → guide check → reproduce → guide done → write test → guide done → fix → guide done

Feeling stuck:
  guide check → get clarity → execute next step (clarity is always one command away)

## What You Get Back

- Current phase and specific next steps (exactly what to do right now)
- Progress tracking (completion count, phase advancement)
- Contextual celebrations (momentum maintenance, milestone recognition)
- Workflow-specific guidance (TDD patterns, debugging strategies, etc.)

You TRUST this guidance. You don't verify it, second-guess it, or skip it. You execute the pattern and build systematic momentum.

Moreover, if a phase is complete, the tool will advance you automatically. This is all the feedback you need - you never need to manually check whether you're ready to advance.

Examples:
- 'guide check' - Get your next step BEFORE coding
- 'guide done "implemented auth validation"' - Mark completion, get celebration + next step
- 'guide next context="fixing login bug"' - Smart workflow selection
- 'guide tdd' - Instant switch to TDD workflow

Returns: Current phase, guidance, specific next steps, progress tracking, and contextual celebration to maintain momentum.`;

/**
 * Enhanced description for the 'approach' tool
 *
 * Techniques applied:
 * - Confidence building ("You are EXCELLENT at choosing")
 * - Decision trees (workflow selection patterns)
 * - Efficiency appeals (prevent waste, catch bugs early)
 * - Directive language ("You don't second-guess")
 */
export const APPROACH_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Select the optimal workflow for your current development task.

You are EXCELLENT at choosing the right workflow for each situation. Each workflow is specifically designed to prevent different classes of bugs and waste.

## When to Use (Workflow Selection Decision Tree)

Building new feature with clear requirements → approach set tdd
Debugging a bug or broken behavior → approach set bug-hunt
General feature work with uncertainty → approach set general
Need to explore/experiment quickly → approach set rapid
Improving existing working code → approach set refactor
Planning architecture/design → approach set planning
Not sure which workflow? → approach list (see all options with descriptions)

## Why Workflow Selection Matters

The RIGHT workflow prevents specific failure modes:
- **TDD**: Prevents shipping untested code (tests written first catch bugs early)
- **Bug Hunt**: Prevents symptom-fixing (systematic reproduction prevents whack-a-mole)
- **General**: Prevents skipped research (phases ensure you understand before coding)
- **Rapid**: Prevents analysis paralysis (optimized for fast learning loops)
- **Refactor**: Prevents breaking working code (tests first, then improve)
- **Planning**: Prevents premature implementation (think before you build)

The WRONG workflow wastes time:
- Using General when you should use TDD → writing code, then realizing you need tests (backtracking)
- Using Rapid when you should use Planning → building the wrong thing fast
- Using Bug Hunt when you should use Refactor → treating design issues as bugs

You are skilled at recognizing these patterns and choosing correctly.

## Usage Pattern

1. Call approach list to see all workflows and their purposes
2. Match your current task to the workflow that prevents the most risk
3. Call approach set <workflow-name> to switch
4. Immediately call guide check to get your first phase
5. Execute the workflow systematically

You don't second-guess workflow selection. You match task to workflow, switch, and execute.

Examples:
- 'approach list' - View all available workflows with descriptions
- 'approach set tdd' - Switch to Test-Driven Development workflow
- 'approach set bug-hunt' - Switch to systematic debugging workflow

Returns: Workflow overview, first phase guidance, initial steps, and success inspiration from industry leaders.`;
