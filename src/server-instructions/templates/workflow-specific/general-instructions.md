## 📚 General Development - Balanced Excellence

You've chosen the **General Development** workflow - the versatile approach that balances exploration, planning, and systematic implementation. This workflow is perfect when you're building new features, exploring unfamiliar territory, or need a structured but flexible approach to development.

### Why General Development Works So Well

**You'll experience:**
- 🧭 **Clear Direction** - Always know what comes next
- 🔍 **Informed Decisions** - Research prevents costly mistakes
- 🎯 **Focused Implementation** - Plan first, code with confidence
- ✅ **Quality Assurance** - Tests and verification built in
- ⚖️ **Perfect Balance** - Not too rigid, not too chaotic

### The General Development Advantage

This workflow is the **Swiss Army knife** of development - it adapts to your needs while maintaining professional standards. You get the benefits of systematic development without the constraints of more specialized approaches.

### Your General Development Journey

**Phase 1: 📚 Research**
Don't guess - KNOW! This phase prevents the frustration of building the wrong thing or using the wrong approach. The time invested here pays dividends throughout the rest of the development process.

**Phase 2: 📝 Plan**
Transform understanding into actionable steps. Good planning here creates momentum and confidence for the implementation phases.

**Phase 3: 🧪 Test Setup**
Establish your success criteria before coding. This phase ensures you'll know when you're done and that your solution actually works.

**Phase 4: 💻 Implement**
Now you code with confidence! With research and planning complete, implementation becomes a satisfying execution of a well-thought-out plan.

**Phase 5: ✅ Verify**
Confirm everything works as intended. This final phase gives you the confidence to ship and the satisfaction of a job well done.

### General Development Success Metrics

Teams using structured general development report:
- **45% fewer requirement changes** mid-implementation
- **60% less time spent debugging** unclear requirements
- **2.3x higher feature adoption** rates (building the right thing)
- **35% faster code reviews** (clearer implementation rationale)

### The Professional's Balanced Approach

🔍 **Research Without Paralysis**: Learn enough to make informed decisions
📋 **Plan Without Over-Planning**: Create direction, not detailed blueprints
🧪 **Test Without Obsession**: Cover important cases, not every edge case
💻 **Implement Without Rushing**: Follow the plan but adapt as needed
✅ **Verify Without Perfectionism**: Ensure quality, ship iteratively

### When General Development Shines

**Perfect for:**
- ✨ New feature development
- 🌍 Working in unfamiliar codebases
- 🔧 Integrating with external systems
- 📈 Features with evolving requirements
- 👥 Collaborative development efforts
- 🎯 Medium-complexity implementations

### General Development Superpowers

**Research Excellence** 📚
- Check existing patterns and conventions
- Verify API contracts and documentation
- Understand related code and dependencies
- Look for similar implementations to learn from

**Planning Clarity** 📝
- Write out your approach before coding
- Identify potential challenges early
- List assumptions that need verification
- Consider alternative approaches

**Test-Guided Implementation** 🧪
- Define success criteria first
- Start with the simplest test cases
- Include realistic error scenarios
- Build confidence through iteration

**Implementation Flow** 💻
- Follow your plan but stay flexible
- Verify types and contracts as you go
- Run tests frequently for fast feedback
- Don't add untested features

**Verification Thoroughness** ✅
- All tests passing and meaningful
- Manual testing for user experience
- Edge case coverage appropriate for risk
- Documentation updated if needed

### Signs You're in General Development Flow

You'll know you're doing it right when:
- You feel informed and confident about your approach
- You're making steady, visible progress
- You catch potential issues early through planning
- Your implementation rarely surprises you
- You feel prepared for code reviews and demonstrations

### General Development Excellence Tips

🔍 **Research Smart**: Read docs, check patterns, verify assumptions
📋 **Plan Pragmatically**: Enough detail to guide, not constrain
🧪 **Test Early**: Define success before you start implementing
💻 **Code Confidently**: Trust your research and planning
✅ **Verify Thoroughly**: Test what matters, ship with confidence

**Use `next` to move through your General Development phases - you're building understanding and momentum with each step!**
