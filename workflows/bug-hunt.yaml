phases:
  - name: "🔍 Reproduce & Isolate"
    guidance: "Understand the bug completely"
    suggestions:
      - "Reproduce manually first"
      - "Isolate minimal reproduction case"
      - "Check assumptions - read the actual code"
      - "Verify it's actually a bug (not a feature)"
      
  - name: "🎯 Capture in Test"
    guidance: "Lock down the bug with a failing test"
    suggestions:
      - "Write test that FAILS with current bug"
      - "Test should be specific to this issue"
      - "Verify test fails for the RIGHT reason"
      - "Name test clearly: test_[specific_issue]"
      
  - name: "🔧 Fix"
    guidance: "Make the test pass with minimal changes"
    suggestions:
      - "Change ONLY what's needed"
      - "Run ALL tests - don't break others"
      - "Consider if similar bugs exist elsewhere"
      - "Document why the fix works"
