3. **Customize suggestions** - Make them specific to your tools and practices
4. **Update guidance** - Reflect your team's standards and preferences

## Creating New Workflows

Use these examples as templates for your own specialized workflows:

```yaml
name: "Your Workflow Name"
description: "Brief description of when to use this workflow"
trigger_hints:
  - "keyword1"
  - "keyword2"
phases:
  - name: "üìã Phase Name"
    guidance: "What to focus on in this phase"
    suggestions:
      - "Specific actionable step"

```

## Tips

- **Keep phases focused** - Each phase should have a clear objective
- **Make suggestions actionable** - Avoid vague advice
- **Use emojis in phase names** - They help identify phases quickly
- **Test your workflows** - Use them on real projects to refine them
